# Selenium-Amazon-Web-Scraping
Using Selenium to Scrape Amazon search result, this program will also request the details page of products and scrape more details

You just have to search what you want on Amazon, and then copy the link.

Run Amazon.py, and then it will aks for a link, and you just paste and enter.

I have scraped hundreds of items on Amazon with this program. If it does not find the element, it will probably input zero as value instead of return error.

I may write a bs4 version later as it is faster.

I also plan to write a program such that everything scraped from Amazon can immediately be imported to database like MySQL, but it takes time.

This program is far from perfect. You are welcome to contribute.
